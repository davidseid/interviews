  - Long form
    - At a fundamental level I'm just a really curious and adaptable person. I've been described as sponge like by friends and family because I love to seek out new environments and soak up everything I can. What I love about being a software engineer is that these traits are so highly rewarded.
    - I came to programming through a love of languages, I used to live and work internationally and I picked up a few foreign languages like Hindi and a bit of Japanese, and I started teaching myself Python as a hobby to understand what computer languages were. 
    - That turned into a deeper study of JavaScript and building full stack web applications. I basically got hooked on the creative joy in building things, particularly the back end system design puzzle and tradeoffs. (optimizing databases, horizontal scaling)
    - I also kind of had a realization about technology, that it isn't about gadgets necessarily, but that technology is actually about knowledge and building off prior knowledge and using automation to abstract away things to free up mental space for tackling new problem spaces. 
    - In my previous life I was a project manager as well, so I appreciate the value in communication, collaboration, and understanding different stakeholders. 
    - Really just looking to contribute to a team of software engineers to help steer a great product to market.
